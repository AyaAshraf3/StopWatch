# StopWatch
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a well-commented Stop Watch system implemented using an ATmega32 Microcontroller.
# Project Overview
The Stop Watch system uses an ATmega32 Microcontroller running at a frequency of 1MHz. It utilizes Timer1 in CTC mode to count the Stop Watch time and displays it on six Common Anode 7-segment displays using multiplexing techniques.
# Hardware Setup
The hardware setup includes the following components:

ATmega32 Microcontroller
Six Common Anode 7-segment displays
7447 BCD to 7-segment decoder
NPN BJT transistors for enabling/disabling 7-segment displays
Push buttons for control
External pull-up and pull-down resistors
Wiring and connections as described in the project specifications
